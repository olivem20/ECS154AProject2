# Project 2 README

Student 1: Olive Maunupau (918816205)
Student 2: Bipasha Sengupta (918004826)

## Project Status
Our project is complete but not outputting everything correctly. Olive was in charge of Problem 1 and 2 and Bipasha took the lead on Problem 3.

## Known Issues
In Problem 2, our input buffer doesn't output the correct code for one cycle only. If you hold the button long, the  buffer will incorrectly hold the same code. In problem 3, we have it so that it Locks and Unlocks if you click the respective buttons 4 times in a row but not 2.

   * For part 3, I struggled with the use of D flip flops since I quite didnâ€™t know how to handle flip flops so I used the YouTube video for reference and basic understanding of how d flip flops work

   * for part 3, we wanted to use FSM and understand FSM through d flip flops so for that we used a YouTube video for reference



## Generative AI Use
We did not need to use Generative AI for this project. We used Youtube videos, the textbook and office hours to make it.
